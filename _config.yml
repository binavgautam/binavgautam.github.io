  Hi, my name's Binav Gautam and im an MS in CS Student at The university of Texas at Dallas. I have experience working on React and Node.js projects, which I have worked on in both my past internships! I have also made several academic Machine Learning projects ranging from NLP to CV, mostly using Tensorflow. Currently, I am exploring the fields of Data Engineering, where I am learning to build ETL Pipelines and perform operations on data using PySpark and Snowflake, and also Cloud Computing, where I am playing around with and studying Microsoft Azure.

          I started this project as a way of learning Data Pipelines and working with streaming data.  I Implemented a data pipeline that extracts comments from a subreddit using the Reddit API and sends them to an Apache Kafka topic. PySpark is used to consume these comments from the topic, process and transform the data, and send the transformed data to another topic. Logstash consumes the transformed data from the topic and indexes it into Elasticsearch, where it is analyzed and visualized using Kibana. This setup allows for real-time processing, transformation, and visualization of Reddit comments, providing insights into discussion trends and patterns within the subreddit.

          Developed and implemented a RNN model from scratch to predict Ethereum price movements using historical price data and trading volumes. Presented results showing RNN predictions closely follow actual price movements, with significant improvements in predictive performance through model tuning.
